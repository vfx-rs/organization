Summary
=======

Assigning project owners helps with trying to organize communications between
the Working Group and other projects within the the Academy Software Foundation.
The goal is to make it easy for contributors and ASWF projects to collaborate
and guide the Rust Working Group Projects.

The chairs' responsibility is to communicate with the ASWF TAC and represent the
Rust Working Group, support the projects, and promote an inclusive community.

The chief architects' responsibility is to manage the project, including
communicating with the wrapped projects of the Rust bindings, supporting
collaborators, keeping the project healthy, promote an inclusive community, and
driving the design of the projects (whether they be Rust bindings, or projects
to support the working group's goal).

Each project should have a primary contact, and a secondary contact. The primary
contact's is responsible for their project, and the secondary contact can act as
the primary contact and temporarily take their responsibility if the primary
contact is unavailable.
